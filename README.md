# Hiking Trails at White's Woods
## Summary
Web map of hiking trails at White's Woods Recreation Area.

In June 2010, I mapped the hiking trails at White's Woods Recreation Area located in Indiana, Pennsylvania.  This was completed while working for [Indiana County Parks & Trails](https://www.indianacountyparks.org/) through the AmeriCorps program.

I thought it would be nice to have a webmap that can guide users while they are visiting the Woods.  There is an [official map](https://www.whitetownship.org/sites/default/files/docs_forms_media/whites-woods-map_1.pdf) of this site, that includes the names of the trails.  That information will be incorporated into this project in the future.

# Technology
The simple webmap application is developed using [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/).  I'm using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and associated plugins to power the webmap.  I also used [Mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) to convert a shapefile version of the trails to geojson.
